#' @description Metabolic profiling NMR dataset of murine urine samples before and after undergoing bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass).
#' @details One dimensional proton NMR spectra of murine urine samples, acquired on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) operating at a frequency of 600.13 MHz and a temperature of 300 K. A standard NMR pulse sequence (\emph{recycle delay-90°-t1-90°-tm-90°-acquisition}) was applied to acquire one-dimensional Proton NMR spectral data, where \emph{t1} was set to 3 μs and \emph{tm} (mixing time) was set to 100 ms. Water suppression was achieved using selective irradiation during a \emph{recycle delay} of 2 s and \emph{tm}. A 90° pulse was adjusted to 10 μs. A total of 128 scans were collected into 64 k data points with a spectral width of 20 ppm.
